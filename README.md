## swu scheduler project

#current tools for scaffoldoing:
html / js front end
php back end - not optimal since not sure whether I could implement the automatic browser alerts with php. on up side, easy to interact with database, and could feasibly achieve everything.

#possible improvements.
- nodejs for backend, with express for routing
- incorporation of testing using mocha (just learning that now)
- ability to authenticate users to make personalized schedulers.
